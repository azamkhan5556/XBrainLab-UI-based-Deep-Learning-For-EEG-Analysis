# XBrainLab-UI-based-Deep-Learning-For-EEG-Analysis
XBrainLab is an open-source EEG analysis toolbox that employs deep learning and explainable AI to turn EEG signals into interpretable visual data. This guide provides instructions on setting up XBrainLab and operating its user interface for EEG data analysis.
Installation

    Install XBrainLab: To install XBrainLab on your system, open your terminal and run the following command: pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/CECNL/XBrainLab
This will install the latest version of XBrainLab and its dependencies.
Dataset Selection

Selecting Your Dataset: Choose an appropriate EEG dataset for analysis. You may opt for datasets provided on the XBrainLab GitHub page (https://github.com/CECNL/XBrainLab) or any open EEG dataset that fits your research needs. 
    Data Preprocessing: XBrainLab provides a comprehensive pipeline for preprocessing EEG data. Follow these general steps within the toolbox:
        Channel selection: Choose relevant EEG channels for your analysis.
        Normalization: Apply normalization to standardize the EEG signal amplitudes.
        Filtering: Use bandpass filters to retain frequencies significant for analysis.
        Resampling: Standardize the sampling rate across the dataset.
        Epoching: Segment the EEG signals around event markers. 
Model Training

Model Training: Use XBrainLab's deep learning framework to train a model on your preprocessed data. The process includes:
        Data splitting: Divide your data into training, validation, and testing sets.
        Model selection: Choose a suitable deep learning model for EEG classification.
        Parameter setting: Configure training parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and epochs.
        Optimization: Select an optimizer and set its parameters.

Evaluation

Model Evaluation: After training, evaluate the model's performance by analyzing metrics such as accuracy, precision, ROC, and kappa values.

Visualization

Visualization and Interpretation: Utilize the built-in visualization tools in XBrainLab for:
        Montage setting: Arrange EEG channels for analysis.
        Saliency maps: Visualize the importance of different features for classification.
        Saliency topographic maps: Observe the spatial distribution of salient features.
        Saliency spectrograms: Examine the frequency-specific importance of features.
        3D saliency plots: Explore three-dimensional representations of feature saliency.

Be sure to rationalize your choice of time points and spatial distributions when creating visualizations.

Saving Outputs

Output Saving: Save your parameters, scripts, model outputs, and figures as directed by the toolbox prompts.
